# My Morals

- the different types of philias: depends, zoophilia and pedophilia are both bad but necrophilia is fine, although you may get infected which is bad for your health.
- love and lust: both are perfectly fine.
- violence; be it fighting, murder, murder of certain individuals, etc: justifiable, although often bad.
- turncoatery; basically lying and betraying: sometimes necessary.
- the idea of authorities, governments, and etc: bad but we have to use them to abolish class society.
