# Characters

you: you're the player, obviously. you're a [age] woman named [name].

# Stats

your stats are health, thirst, hunger, insanity, trust.

health is 100% normally, you take damage from shit and then you die.

thirst and hunger basically act like you'd expect, when they get to 0 you start to starve/dehydrate until you die.

insanity starts at 0% (i know nobody is entirely sane and pure sanity would seem alien to us but this is a video game) and goes up when you see eldritch abominations, causing hallucinations and your trust meter to be lowered.
