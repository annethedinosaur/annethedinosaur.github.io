# Characters

you: you're the player, obviously. you're a [age] woman named [name].

# Stats

your stats are health, thirst, hunger, insanity, trust.

health is 100% normally, you take damage from shit and then you die.

thirst and hunger basically act like you'd expect, when they get to 0 you start to starve/dehydrate until you die.

insanity starts at 0% (i know nobody is entirely sane and pure sanity would seem alien to us but this is a video game) and goes up when you see eldritch abominations, causing hallucinations and your trust meter to be lowered.

# Locations

locations are your ship, arkham, the majority of the solar system, azathoth, 

azathoth is at the center of the universe. around him there's all the things with flutes, with "on mount golgotha" from scp containment breach being played by them. when you go within a distance that they're hearable from, you go insane. azathoth would be a black hole or something random but censored out so as to convery a sort of creepy factor because your brain is flushing it out.
